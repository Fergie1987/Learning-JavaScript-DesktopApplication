     <label>
          Objects should now be created within your game world. In the Pac-Man game, points are scored when pellets are eaten. <br><br>

          Code will now be added to destory object bodies when an in game collision occurs. <br><br>
          
          An Array will be required to hold which bodies should be destroyed. A For loop will then destory bodies held within this Array. <br><br> The Array length is then set to zero, this action removes any content. <br><br>
