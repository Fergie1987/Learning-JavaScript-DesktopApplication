     <label>
          Now that we have objects within our world and canvas, we now need to setup our code so that objects such as pellets can be destroyed and points can be scored! <br><br>

          You will now be adding code that will destory the bodies of Box2D object when a collision occurs. <br><br>
          
          We require an Array of bodies to be destroyed and a for loop to destory bodies held within the array. <br><br>
