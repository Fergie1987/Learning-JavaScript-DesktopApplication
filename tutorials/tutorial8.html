     <label>
     In this tutorial we will be adding the code to move Ghosts between two walls. <br><br>
     
     The direction of the ghost will change after a collision is registered with a ghost and wall (for example, the walls named leftTurn or rightTurn can be used). <br><br>

     The ghost object direction change cannot be handled within the contactListener, this is a known bug within Box2D but we can still update variables after collision. <br><br>

     The solution is to create boolean variables and update these after collision. <br><br> 
     
     The update function can then be used to check the status of the variables, if there has been a change to the value, then the direction of the ghost should change.  <br><br>
     
     Your challenge is to now create this solution and change the direction of the Ghost objects you added. <br><br>
