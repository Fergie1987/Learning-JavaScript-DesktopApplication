     <label>
     In this tutorial we will be adding the code to move ghosts between two walls. <br><br>
     
     The direction of the ghost will change after a collision is registered with a ghost and wall (for example, the walls named leftTurn or rightTurn should be used). <br><br>

     Ghosts direction changes cannot be handled directly within the contactListener. This is a known bug within Box2D. We will update boolean variables using the contactListener instead to overcome this issue. <br><br> 
     
     The update function is then used to check the boolean variables. If there has been a value change, the direction of the ghost should change.  <br><br>
     
     Your challenge within this task is to create this solution and change the direction of the ghost objects. <br><br>
