     <label>

     You will now be adding pellets to the maze. <br><br>
     
     Pac-Man scores points for eating the pellets within the maze <br><br>

     The pellet positions will be held within two arrays. These arrays hold the X and Y co-ordinate positions. <br><br>

     For loops are again used to extract these co-ordinates from the Arrays and these are used to add the objects to the Box2D world. <br><br>
