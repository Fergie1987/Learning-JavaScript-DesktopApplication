     <label>
     The end of the game should now be developed. <br><br>

     Please use your new JavaScript skills to develop and complete the final tasks.  <br><br>

     The challenges within this task are:<br><br> 

     1: Create a variable to hold the number of pellets within the maze. <br><br> 
     2: Reduce the number of pellets within this variable when a Pac-Man and Pellet collision occurs. <br><br> 
     3: Use a known function that continuously checks the variable and end the game if the variable value reaches zero. <br><br> 
     4: A final alert message should display to the player and remember to include the final score!<br><br> 
     
     After these challenges have been completed, the Pac-Man game should be fully functional. <br><br>  
     
     The JavaScript concepts and skills learned within this tutorial should be used within your next challenge. <br><br>
